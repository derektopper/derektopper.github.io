### Project Description

This project was completed for the Cal Football team. Coach Wilcox approached our group with a problem that their coaching staff faces every day. They don’t know how hard each athlete is actually working and they don’t understand their data as well as they want. So how do we figure out which athletes actually got better that day? 

Thus, our project's solution is Tracklete, an Athlete Management System, that aggregates and elegantly displays various player metrics, using a wide variety of internal and external player loads.

Features included:

* **Streamlined dashboard** to record, manage, and quantify exertion for athletes in many different sports.
* Provide coaches with **valuable insight on athletes’ exertion** in real time
* **Workout Score** - Move away from the eye test when strength coaches are assessing their athletes during both offseason and in-season training to see how hard athletes are working during their workout in relation to the percentage of their max heart rate (HR).
* **Data aggregation** - Save time by aggregating and summarizing the data - tailored to the coach and sport


### Contributions

As the only data scientist on the project, my main task was to analyze all of the data we recieved and develop a pipeline to feed it into our web-based solution. 

I also had serve as a liason between the business-focused members of our team and those developing the actual web portal, which I also helped with.

### Challenges Overcame

Initially, we had attempted to develop both a computer vision-based and GPS-based solution for identifying football playcalling from game film or Catapult data. We were unable to get this to work due to both data privacy issues and a lack of both time and computer vision experience.

### Accomplishments

We were able to develop a system that had a various advantages over current market solutions. 

These included:

- **User-Researched:** Our project included tailored statistics requested by the Cal Football coaches.
- **Cleanly Presented:** Our solution included easy to palate statistics to provide player-based information seemlessly.
- **Open-Source:** Our solution was open-source and is available on Github
- **Consolidation:** Aggregates data from various different sources by parsing CSV datasets.
- **Profiles:** Personalized tracking of player workouts.
