These are some of the programming coursework projects I completed while I was an undergrad at UC-Berkeley.

I excluded all the homework assignments from the list and did not include any assignments that are elsewhere on this website.

### Computer Science 61B, Fall 2018, UC Berkeley:

**Graphs:** Used Traversals and ShortestPathTrees to develop a library package to provide facilities for manipulating graphs, and clients which use the package to provide directions between two locations.

**Amazons:** Implemented an Argentinian board game called Amazons. [The rules and spec is available here](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa18/materials/proj/proj2/index.html)

**Enigma:** Programmed a replica of the Enigma Machine, using Java, which incorporated a substitution cipher, and various settable mechanical systems and permutations. The project spec is available [here.](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa18/materials/proj/proj1/index.html)

**Galaxies:** Used Java to build the GUI puzzle game Galaxies where users solve various problems to solve a puzzle. More information is about the project I completed is [here.](https://inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b/fa18/materials/proj/proj0/index.html) 

### Data Science 100, Spring 2017, UC Berkeley:

**Kaggle:** Built Lasso and Ridge models to predict the sale price of sold homes in Ames, Iowa.

**Classifier:** Created a classifier that can distinguish spam (junk or commercial or bulk) emails from ham (non-spam) emails. 

**Twitter:** Used Natural Language Processing to analyze actual data from the Twitter API from the US President's Twitter behavior.

### Data Science 8, Fall 2016, UC Berkeley:

**Classification:** I built a k-nearest neighbors classifier to identify the genre of a song using only the number of times wors appear in the song's lyrics.

**Inference and Capital Punishment:** In this project, I conducted a natural experiment to investigate the relationship between capital punishment and murder. I implemented various statistical tests, created visualizations and drew and presented conclusions.
 
**California Water Usage:** Used data science techniques to evaluate water data and income data to evaluate the connections between usage, geography and income in California.

### Computer Science 61A, Spring 2016, UC Berkeley:

**Scheme:** In this project, I had to develop an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language. I also had to implement some small programs in Scheme, a simple but powerful functional language.

**Ants:** For this project, I created a tower defensegame, called Ants Vs. SomeBees, PopCap Games' Plants Vs. Zombies, where ants attempt to defend their queen from the evil bees that invade your territory.  Using functional and object-oriented programming paradigms, as well as understanding, extending, and testing a large program, the project was designed to help me understand how programs are built. 

**Maps:** In this project, I used Python to deploy a machine learning algorithm to  create a colored Voronoi diagram of Berkeley restaurant ratings using the Yelp academic dataset.

**Hog:** In this project, I developed a simulator and multiple strategies for the dice game Hog. I used control statementsand higher-order functionstogether, using Python, to create a game with a trained computer opponent. 

### Computer Science 10, Fall 2015, UC Berkeley:

**Pokemon:** Created a text-based Pokemon game and battling system, in the visual language Snap!. The game contained the original 150 Pokemon and allowed the user to partake in three levels of a replica of an original Pokemon game. 

**Deal Or No Deal:** Used Snap! to create a copy of the online version of the game Deal Or No Deal.
