title: Design Patterns vs. Anti-Patterns
category: blog

Anti-Patterns are more valuable than design patterns.

With design patterns you could arguable improve a system, improve code readability, avoid half-baked, over-engineered solutions, etc.

With anti-patterns, you will be able to spot what people get wrong. 

An eye for anti-patterns can take a bad system and at least make it neutral.

An eye for design patterns could arguably take a neutral system and make it better.

Most systems are ripe with design issues and code smells, and have no right to be applying design patterns on top of.

Get the anti-patterns right, first. Then master design patterns?

Is one is well-versed in both, then all the merrier to be using both in practice. 

Compare: 

anti-patterns might be more like treating software as a pincushion, you poke at it to see where all the leaks are. 
design patterns might be more like treating software like a punching bag, where you beat it into shape, forming it exactly how you intend.

I personally treat everything in life like a pincushion: where are the flaws, where are the holes in the argument, what alternatives are there, can we ever know truth, do morals exist, is this a simulation, *existential breakdown* etc.

So maybe I'm naturally biased towards having an eye for anti-patterns. Perhaps pairing my architecty self with a visionary design patterns person would conquer the world!

As a matter of fact, I have noticed I worked best when paired with somebody who generates endless ideas of "This is how we can do this", where I serve as their filter: "This is what's wrong with everything you suggested, here's the best idea"
