category: blog
---

In an effort to emulate my superiors, I have decided to bite [Julien Smith's amazing idea](http://www.inoveryourhead.net/2012/02/22/lessons-i-learned-reading-over-200-books/) of running through the books I've read and summarizing what they've taught me.

I would love to start reflecting on what I read every year, since reading is such a major part of my life, and Julien's format is just amazing.
