With so many soliloquies of SOLID Principles online, ripe with the same old definitions, theoretical verbosity, and yet, the most basic of examples, I've always found it difficult to digest and keep it all in mind while developing.

So I wanted to create a condensed checklist that is wall hang-worthy.

## SOLID Principles Checklist

- SOLID is a means to an end, not an end in itself
- The end is maintainability.
- SOLID dogmatism should not dirty the code with Needless Complexity

### Single Responsibility Principle

- Each class does one thing, and does one thing well
- Each method in a class does one thing, and does one thing well
- If a classes' behavior ever changed, it should impact most of its methods
- Aim for short enough methods that can fit on your screen
- Avoid numerous parameters in methods

### Open Closed Principle


### Liskov Substitution Principle


### Interface Segregation Principle


### Dependency Inversion Principle
