For this project, I worked with the Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley and a well-known professional basketball team to analyze the relationships between fans of eSports and their team. 

As the Founder and President of the Sports Analytics Group at Berkeley, I have had the opportunity to oversee various projects with our members and pro sports teams. 

## Introduction

This project explores the relationship between the fanbases of the Cleveland Cavaliers and the most popular eSports games, professional leagues, and teams through an analysis on the shared followers between Twitter accounts of Cavaliers-related pages (team, players, fan services) and major eSports pages (games, teams, leagues). The analysis focuses on four key areas: (1) the current state of the eSports industry (2) general overlap statistics between Cavaliers and eSports fans, (3) Cavalier fan gaming preferences, and (4) the eSports brand strength of 100 Thieves, subject of the Cavalier’s most recent eSports investment. The goal of this analysis is to provide insight into the most popular eSports brands amongst Cavaliers fans and to identify opportunities for the Cavaliers to expand their eSports presence.

## Analysis

There were two primary components of this analysis: (1) Twitter page overlap to determine mutual fans, and (2) current eSports industry data for insights into key differentiators of Cavaliers fans compared to the general public. Data for (1) was obtained by using Python to scrape all of the followers of over 50 Cavaliers and eSports related Twitter pages and group unique followers of different pages to analyze overlapping data from different perspectives. Data for (2) was obtained via publicly available eSports industry data on www.esportsearnings.com and www.newzoo.com. The following analysis focuses on interpreting this data to provide insight and recommendations towards potential avenues of growing the Cleveland Cavalier’s eSports fanbase.

## eSports Overview

The eSports industry is rapidly evolving and expanding, and it is critical for investors to keep up. In 2017, the eSports economy (total revenues from media rights, advertisements, sponsorship merchandise & tickets, publisher fees) grew to $700M, a 214% growth from 2015. The total audience (now ~385 million worldwide) is growing at a similar rate. With this rapid expansion has come a shift in popular game genres that will be explored throughout this analysis.  
This analysis will focus on four main game categories: (1) first-person shooters (FPS), (2) multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA), (3) massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG), and (4) sports. While FPS games previously reigned king for both casual and professional gamers, a relatively new addition to the eSports world – the MOBA – has quickly taken over as the leader in terms of active player base and tournament revenues. Another previously popular game genre, the MMORPG, has also gone down in popularity in the shadow of MOBA’s and has much less potential for tournament-style play. The total active player base for sports games is difficult to measure, as many play these games offline, but the fanbase of major sports games has remained relatively steady. These trends can be seen in Table 1 below, which breaks down the magnitude of the professional and casual player bases of the top 10 games of 2017.
