// angular is awesome

// I've been living under a rock

// Never used anything on front end past mere libraries like Prototype and jQuery

// The whole directives thing
	// It's like looking at some weird HTML syntax version of Ruby, but all the controllers are controllers of the front end
// Form validations

// routing, etc
