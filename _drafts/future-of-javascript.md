Abrasive Swirling Murk refernce.

Compare all the JS flavors to the subgenres of metal.

List them: angular knockout backbone, vue etc.

Then go into all the tools, like transpilers like gulp, webpack, dep management, etc.

Story: 
	I started as a developer ten years ago, it was php, mysql, html, css, javascript. 
	Ajax was the hot thing. 
	Riding the wave of the web applications era (gmail, google calendar, youtube)
	Ruby on Rails was the new kid on the block, wowing everybody what is possible in web applications.
	But web development is evolving seemingly exponentially 
	(crunch number here, would be interesting..) 
	Make a graph of that

jQuery: just when the dust settled on JS libraries, and I thought we were stuck with jQuery for a long time, a new revolution has been in the works.

Parody an example of deciding to use JS on an app and all the loopholes that have to be jumped. 

Compare to a "past" example of bunch of devs meeting up in the company trying to decide what to use between angular vs react vs others, despite not really knowing when to use each of them?

Where is JavaScript going?
Refernce Douglas Crockford's video Seif project: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0w6tZEbrHIY&list=LLIr-5lcUVl_C8IrzQmICZuQ&index=1
Give quick summary of it's goal: ambition transformation of the web for sake of security, using JavaScript

Speculate: when the dust will settle.

What will come out of all the competition?

Have there been examples like JavaScript in the past where it goes through a contant cycle of self reevaluation?

Mention web-specific pattern of releasing new versions of frameworks that break previous and are not backwards compatible: vagrant, Ruby on Rails, Angular, ZF3? And why is this acceptable in the web development world? Why is it that web development is so loose sometimes, whereas virtual all other engineering disciplines and even other areas of the software development discplines are more strict?
