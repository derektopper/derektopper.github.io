title: Laravel, Where Have You Been All My Life?
category: blog

Post about adventures with Rails, and initial admirations of Rails in mid 2000s, background in smarty templateing and no framework at all, and how chaotic it was.
Expand on experience with custom MVC frameworks experienced
Expand on initial wow I had over cake php but never had the opportunity to truly work with it.
And how I never got around to touching Yii, Zend Framework really, and others.
Conclude I basically don't have a lot of php framework experience really,
but that Laravel is really amazing.
I would wonder how it stacks against other major php frameworks, but I wonder if I should waste my time when they are all clearly on the decline and have been for years.

Plus, besides Laravel, I only ever see code ignitor ever being mentioned in job postings
