title: What Makes a Senior Web Developer?
category: blog
---

In the case of being tenure-based, they say one must spend [10,000 hours](http://www.wisdomgroup.com/blog/10000-hours-of-practice/) coding in order to perfect their craft. 

Some "junior" developers hit this mark in only a few years. Other "senior" developers who have been at it for over a decade will never even hit this mark.

Such is the futility in determining qualification based on tenure.

Company-specific definitions for "Senior Developer" are even worse. 

Imagine [lazy, dumb, but successful](http://blog.codinghorror.com/how-to-be-lazy-dumb-and-successful/) developers who have sat at the same company for years, doing the same unchallenging routine work.

That sort of setup allows them to ascend to "Senior Developer" because they have amassed company knowledge over the years and know domain and company-specific applications.

What's worse is when a brilliant 22-year-old gets hired as just a mere "web developer" and blows all the senior developers out of the water.

For all of these reasons, a senior developer should be considered as somebody who:

* Can be left unattended, handling their own
* Leads or inspires others
* Are looked up to by others for advice and guidance
